# TreeSitter

## Inspect Tree

You can use :InspectTree inside a file for a language you have installed a parser for and see the syntax tree nodes generated by treesitter and the parser.

```
:InspectTree
```

## Keymap not work
If keymaps config by setup function not work, as Treesitter uses a different parser for every language, please check whether the language parser installed or not.

Use below command to get a list of all available languages and their installation status.

```
:TSInstallInfo
```

 Parsers not on this list can be added manually by following the command:

```
:TSInstall <language_to_install>
```
